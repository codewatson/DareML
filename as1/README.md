In this assignment, you will experiment with commonly used classification algorithms on a real-world dataset. You are allowed to use MATLAB or Python scripts. For MATLAB, you will find R2013b in http://software.usc.edu/matlab/. Without specific description, you are not allowed using Matlab toolbox functions like knnclassify, knnsearch. For Python, we only allow Python 2.7 and we strongly recommend to use Anaconda2 (https://www.continuum.io/ downloads) for Python 2.7 and you are allowed using other libraries in Anaconda2 except machine learning packages such as scikit-learn. Your script should be executable under the Anaconda2 environment and we will grade your code in the same environment. You can build your own functions or modules, however, you should be careful to include them into your submission. If you use other packages not included in Anaconda2 and we fail to run your code, we won’t regrade it after installing required packages. You should implement k-nearest neighbor(kNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms by yourself. Below, we describe the steps that you need to take to accomplish this programming assignment.
Dataset: We have preprocessed the Glass Identification Data Set from UCI’s machine learning data repository. The training/test sets are provided in Blackboard as train.txt and test.txt. For data description, please see https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification.
