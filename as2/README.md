In this assignment, you will study the linear regression as well as some standard feature selection techniques. You are allowed to use MATLAB or Python scripts. For MATLAB, you will find R2013b in http://software.usc.edu/matlab/. Without specific description, you are not allowed using Matlab toolbox functions like knnclassify, knnsearch. For Python, we only allow Python 2.7 and we strongly recommend to use Anaconda2 (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Python 2.7 and you are allowed using other libraries in Anaconda2 except machine learning pack- ages such as scikit-learn, unless specified otherwise. Your script should be executable under the Anaconda2 environment and we will grade your code in the same environment. You can build your own functions or modules, however, you should be careful to include them into your submission. If you use other packages not included in Anaconda2 and we fail to run your code, we won’t regrade it after installing required packages. You should implement all optimization algorithms by yourself. Below, we describe the steps that you need to take to accomplish this programming assignment.


3.1 Dataset

Loading We will use the Boston Housing Data Set from UCI’s machine learning data repository. You can download the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing. If you are using Python, you are encouraged to use the sklearn.datasets module to load the data. See http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston. html for example.
The dataset contains 506 data points, where each data point has 13 features attributes and 1 target attribute. The task is to predict the value of the target using the values of 13 features. If you load the data from the UCI website, the last attribute (MEDV ) is the target. If you load the data using sklearn.datasets module, the target attribute is already separated into the target field.
